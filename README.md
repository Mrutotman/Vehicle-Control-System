# 🏎️ VCS: Vehicle Control System (Shell Eco-marathon Edition)

The **Vehicle Control System (VCS)** is a closed-loop, RTOS-driven control architecture designed specifically for the **Shell Eco-marathon (SEM)** competition. It serves as the high-reliability bridge between high-level navigation (Raspberry Pi) and high-power execution ($60\text{V}$ BLDC Motor and Stepper-based Steering).

## 🤖 AI Collaboration
This system was architected and refined in collaboration with **Gemini 3 Flash**. The collaboration focused on:
* Transitioning from monolithic code to a **Modular Architecture**.
* Implementing **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Simulation** for safe bench testing without $60\text{V}$ power.
* Integrating **SEM-compliant safety protocols** (DMS, Heartbeat, and Brake Overrides).

## 🚀 Version History

### **v1.3 and v1.2 (Current - 1500W Motor Driver & HIL Sim)**
*The "Reliability" release. Focuses on standardized hardware and digital twin verification.*
* **Powertrain Upgrade:** Optimized for **1500W prebuilt e-bike BLDC motor drivers**, removing the instability of DIY commutation logic.
* **Full Digital Twin Integration:** Physics-based simulation module (`VCS_Simulation`) to emulate vehicle dynamics without 60V power.
* **High-Speed Binary Telemetry:** 20Hz Uplink protocol (`0xAA` frames) for real-time Raspberry Pi monitoring.
* **Telemetry Heartbeat Logic:** State machine requires a validated "Brain-to-Heart" handshake before entering Autonomous mode.
* **Simplified Safety Path:** Streamlined the safety hierarchy for faster response times using prebuilt driver logic.

### **v1.1 (Current - Modular ESP32/STM32)**
*Major upgrade focusing on steering precision, power management, and SEM technical compliance.*
* **Stepper Steering:** Replaced legacy DC motors with high-torque microstep drivers.
* **Smart Shaft Locking:** Integrated `ENA` logic to manage holding torque, reducing current draw to **0.4A** during manual idle to conserve battery.
* **Strict Timing:** Enforced a $35\mu\text{s}$ step delay limit to prevent motor vibration.
* **Digital Twin Sim:** Added `VCS_Simulation` to test UART telemetry and safety logic without engaging the $60\text{V}$ rail.
* **Multi-Architecture ADC Mapping:** Auto-scales feedback between 12-bit (STM32/ESP32) and 10-bit (AVR) hardware.

### **v1.0 (Legacy - Prototype)**
*Initial prototype build focusing on core connectivity.*
* **DC Motor Steering:** Basic PWM/DIR control via H-Bridge.
* **Core State Machine:** First draft of the SIDLAK state transitions.
* **Direct Logic:** Monolithic loop structure without modular isolation.

## 🛡️ SIDLAK & SEM Safety Architecture
The system utilizes a strict priority hierarchy. Motor power is strictly prohibited unless the system evaluates all safety conditions as "Clear."

| State | SEM Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **INIT** | Self-Test | Boot sequence and internal hardware health check. |
| **IDLE** | Safety Standby | System alive but motor disabled; awaiting RPi heartbeat. |
| **MANUAL** | Human Control | Driver-operated via throttle and steering. |
| **AUTONOMOUS** | Computer Control | Requires **active DMS hold** and RPi communication. |
| **FAULT** | Fail-Safe | Triggered by comms loss or sensor spikes. **Instant Motor Kill.** |
| **ESTOP** | Emergency Stop | Physical hardware lockout; requires hard power cycle. |
