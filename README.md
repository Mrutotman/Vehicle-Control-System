# 🏎️ VCS: Vehicle Control System (Shell Eco-marathon Edition)

The **Vehicle Control System (VCS)** is a high-reliability, RTOS-driven control architecture designed for the **Shell Eco-marathon (SEM)**. It serves as the deterministic bridge between high-level autonomous navigation (Raspberry Pi) and high-power execution (1500W BLDC Motor & Stepper Steering).

## 🤖 AI Collaboration
This system was architected and refined in collaboration with **Gemini 3.1 Pro**. Key focus areas included:
* **Hardware Security & PCB Design:** Engineering a custom 100x100mm dual-layer PCB featuring strict galvanic isolation, dual ground planes, and an optocoupler "moat" to protect 3.3V logic from 60V motor noise.
* **Mbed OS Integration:** Transitioning to a multi-threaded architecture on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE.
* **Safety Engineering:** Implementing a Hardware Watchdog, CRC16 checksums, and prioritized interrupt-based overrides.
* **Digital Twin:** A HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) simulation module for lab-testing logic without high-voltage power.

## 🛡️ SIDLAK Safety Architecture
The VCS enforces a strict priority hierarchy. Motor power is physically impossible unless the system evaluates all safety conditions as "Clear."

| State | SEM Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **INIT** | Self-Test | Boot sequence, optocoupler lockout, and hardware health check. |
| **IDLE** | Safety Standby | System alive; motor disabled; awaiting RPi heartbeat/handshake. |
| **MANUAL** | Human Control | Primary mode. Driver-operated via throttle pedal and steering. |
| **AUTONOMOUS**| Computer Control | Requires **active DMS hold** and verified 10Hz RPi heartbeat. |
| **FAULT** | Fail-Safe | Triggered by comms loss or sensor spikes. **Instant Motor Kill.** |
| **ESTOP** | Emergency Stop | Physical hardware lockout; requires manual hard power cycle. |

1. **The 5V Translation Bridge:** The **TXS0108E** high-speed bidirectional level shifter guarantees that 5V noise from the stepper driver (`MISTECON`), Speed Sensor (`SPS+`), and shift signals (`3PS`, `RVRS`) cannot back-feed into the 3.3V logic pins. 
2. **Common-Anode Stepper Wiring:** The `MISTECON` port outputs 5V on all positive pins. The Nano triggers steps by pulling the negative pins (`PUL-`, `DIR-`, `ENA-`) to ground via the level shifter. 
3. **The Analog Clean Room:** The V1.4 board routes the `D9` PWM through an RC low-pass filter (`C1`=10µF, `R1`=10kΩ) to flatten it into true DC, then pushes it through the **LM358 Op-Amp** to buffer the current to the `THRTS+` terminal.
4. **Active-Low Fail-Safes:** All critical digital inputs (`DMSC`, `ESC`, `BRKP`, `ROTARY`) are wired active-low. If a wire is severed during the race, the system safely defaults to a deactivated/neutral state.

## 💻 Building and Testing (HIL Simulation)
To safely test vehicle logic before plugging into the physical V1.4 board:
1.  Set `#define SIMULATION_MODE 1` in `vcs_constants.h`.
2.  Open **PlatformIO**, select the `env:nano33ble` environment, and click **Upload**.
3.  Monitor the OLED and Serial Monitor (**115200 baud**) for physics emulation.
4.  Ground the **DMSC** terminal to watch the system transition to **AUTO** via the digital twin.
